## Build Setup

A very simple application built using VueJs, NuxtJS, Vuetify.
Based on Three Columns wireframe, but was changed a lot.

Has 2 main pages:
* About Us (also used as home-page)
* Trips

These are the main steps I took as part of the development:


There are many things still needs to be done:



There's much more to learn.
 
```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

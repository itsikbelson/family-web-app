## Application Overview
`family-web-app` is a very simple application built using VueJS, NuxtJS, Vuetify.
The layout was created based on [Vuetify's three columns wireframe](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/examples/wireframes/three-column/), with changes applied on it.

The application has 2 main pages:
* About Us (also used as home-page), which includes a simple card
* Trips, which includes a Carousel with pictures (not really from trips).

The application was created in order to experience with the frameworks above.
The application is not complete, and there's a lot more to do.
